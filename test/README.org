* About this directory test

The directory ~ob-dart/test/ob-dart-snippets/~ contains Dart snippet samples,
which are transformed using the wrapper files in ~ob-dart/tool/ob-dart-no-main-snippet-wrappers~.

The wrapper files wrap the snippets into runnable manually-testable generated
Dart files and place the generated Dart files into ~/test/tmp-generated-dart~.

From all dart-like snippets in bodys, generate wrapped Dart files to tmp-generated-dart by running

   ~source ./gen-all-dart-from-wrappers-and-bodies.esh~
